Fitness Function: The fitness function simply has the robot move in the x direction.

Morphospace: This body creates shapes by extending in either the x, y, or z direction from any previous links, allowing for many possible shapes and sizes. While the fitness function mostly allows for slow shimmying, it sometimes bounces when the figure is generated with legs/arms. 
*Note my assignment 7 was incorrect as it did not allow for links to be generated from any part of the body, but this has since been fixed, allowing for generation from any previous link to create links with multiple child links. 

The bodies are generated based on the direction the last body was generated, as it affects how the next joints need to be lined up. For instance, if moving in the same direction, the next joint will be offset by the full length of the body in that direction, while when changing directions, the next joint will be offset by the dimensions of the new link in the old direction plus the dimensions of the new link in the new direction (ex. offset x by x/2 when coming from the x direction and y by y/2 when going to the y direction). This will be more clearly shown in the diagram here:

The top section indicates how this robot can generate new links. As mentioned before, it extends in the x, y, and z directions and is able to generate new links from any of the existing links. 
The bottom section shows an example of evolution for this robot, where the initial link extends int the x direction while maintaining the ability to generate new links from any existing link. 


Sensors are generated/assigned by keeping track of which links need sensors, in an list of 0s and 1s, with 1s representing sensors. Additionally, the index of this list coorelates to the name of the sensor in question.

Evolution: This robot evolves by extending its initial link in the X direction continuously. This is done in the mutation function within solution.py, which increments a constant called dx stored in the constants file. This variable is then added on to the initial link in create_body() every time the list of links is generated in a for loop, which ultimately increases the length of the first link as more generations pass. 

Steps to run the program: Open Command Prompt/Git Bash and move to a local directory where you want to add the git repo using the cd command. cd (insert directory name here)

Clone the repository using the following command: git clone https://github.com/SofianR2/mybots.git

Select the repository using the following command: cd https://github.com/SofianR2/mybots.git

Check your current branch using the following command: git branch

If the branch highlighted is not finalProject, input the following commands to change to this branch: git fetch origin phc3d

git checkout phc3d

Make sure to run the command git pull to ensure that the code is the latest available.

Now type the command python search.py to run the simulation.* *If this doesnâ€™t work, try running python3 search.py instead
